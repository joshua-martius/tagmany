# TagMany Obsidian Plugin
Allows you to add the same tag(s) to multiple notes within a specific directory.

Using it on the root directory and tagging canvases is not supported (yet). 

## How to Use
1. Right-click the folder where you want to add the tags.
2. Select "Tag all Notes in this Folder" from the menu.
3. Enter the tags you want to add, separated by commas.
4. (Optional) Check the "Include Subfolders" box if you want to apply the tags to all notes in the folder's subdirectories as well.
5. Click "Submit."
6. You're done! The tags have been added to the selected notes.
